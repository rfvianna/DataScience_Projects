# Data Science Projects
This repository contains the following projects, presented on Jupyter Notebook format:
- ["**CarPrices_Regression**"](https://github.com/rfvianna/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/CarPrices_Regression/LinearRegressionProject_CarPrices.ipynb)
  
  - Objective: estimate a vehicle's value/price based on the features from a given dataset. Also, regression and pricing analysis can provide a better understanding as to underlying factors that can cause depreciation of a vehicle's value.
  
- ["**EuropeanSkiResorts_Regression**"](https://github.com/rfvianna/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/EuropeanSkiResorts_Regression/EuropeanSkiResorts.ipynb)
  
  - Objective: estimate the price of the day pass of european ski resorts. Through explainability, it's possible to understand which aspects are relevant to the daily pass price of each resort and identify resorts with a good cost-benefit tradeoff.

  
- ["**Income_Classification**"](https://github.com/rfvianna/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/Income_Classification/ClassificationProject_Income.ipynb)
  
  - Objective: classify whether people have an income higher or lower than 50k reais. These results can help identify factors that contribute to social inequality, but also understand how public policies can best be implemented and designed in order to confront these issues.

  
- ["**Malnutrition_Clustering**"](https://github.com/rfvianna/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/Malnutrition_Clustering/ClusteringProject_Malnutrition.ipynb)

  - Objective: cluster countries with similar malnutrition indexes. Also, given the analysis it's possible to establish targeted campaigns for the countries in each group, such as: humanitarian relief, campaigns against obesity and so on.
